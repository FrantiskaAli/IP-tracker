# IP tracjer
Frontend mentor challenge.
## Description

Created this challenge using Next.js. It is simple one paged app that lets you find rough location of IP address that you searched for.
To create this application I needed to use Leafletjs and ipify. Style is based on the mockup on frontend mentor pages.

## Usage

Type IP address in search textarea and search.
